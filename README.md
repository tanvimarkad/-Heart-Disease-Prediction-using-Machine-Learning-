📌 Project: Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning  
 This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals using machine learning algorithms. The model is trained on clinical data and leverages various features like age, cholesterol level, resting blood pressure, and more to generate predictions.

- Built a machine learning model to predict heart disease based on patient health data.  
- Used Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn) for preprocessing and training ML algorithms.  
- Achieved accurate results using Logistic Regression and KNN classifiers.  
- Visualized results using Matplotlib and evaluated using confusion matrix and accuracy score.

📁 Dataset
heart.csv – A structured dataset containing clinical data such as age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.

📊 Workflow
Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values and encoded categorical data.

Normalized continuous features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized correlations, distributions, and key patterns in the data.

Model Building

Implemented multiple ML models:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Compared performance metrics of each model.

Evaluation

Evaluated models using Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and ROC Curve.

✅ Results
Achieved high accuracy using Logistic Regression.

The model can help in early-stage detection of heart disease risks.
