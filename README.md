# 📌 Project: Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to **predict the likelihood of heart disease** in individuals using machine learning algorithms.  
The model is trained on clinical data and uses features like **age**, **cholesterol**, **resting blood pressure**, etc.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📁 Dataset
- `heart.csv` – Structured dataset containing clinical data such as:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Cholesterol
  - Blood pressure
  - Chest pain type, etc.

---

## 📊 Workflow

### 🔹 Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and encoded categorical data
- Normalized continuous features

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized correlations, distributions, and patterns
- Used bar plots, heatmaps, and pair plots

### 🔹 Model Building
- Implemented and compared multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Tree

### 🔹 Evaluation
- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall
  - ROC Curve

---

## ✅ Results
- Achieved **high accuracy** using **Logistic Regression**
- Helpful in early detection of heart disease risk
