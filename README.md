📌 Project: Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals using machine learning algorithms. The model is trained on clinical data and leverages various features like age, cholesterol level, resting blood pressure, and more to generate predictions.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📁 Dataset
heart.csv – A structured dataset containing clinical data such as age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.

🔁 Workflow
🔹 Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values and encoded categorical data

Normalized continuous features

🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized correlations, distributions, and key patterns in the data

🔹 Model Building
Implemented multiple ML models:

✅ Logistic Regression

✅ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

✅ Decision Tree

Compared performance metrics of each model

🔹 Evaluation
Evaluated models using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall

ROC Curve

✅ Results
Achieved high accuracy using Logistic Regression

The model can help in early-stage detection of heart disease risks
